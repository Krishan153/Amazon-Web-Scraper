Amazon Price Checker

Amazon is always combating web scrapers to ensure that bots are unable to pull data from their web pages. Here is the newest iteration to a webscraper built with BeautifulSoup that is able to pull data from an Amazon product page and send the user an email if the price is below the user's buying limit. Perfect for the upcoming holidays to see if gifts are within budget!

**Please note in order for this webscraper to run '''pip install bs4''' in your terminal**

Run instructions
- Download the scraper file
- cd to the correct folder the file is downloaded to
- Type '''python3 Amazon.py''' in terminal
